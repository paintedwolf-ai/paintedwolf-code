// AdmissionCandidateConvergedSplitWorkForTest exposes the compact scheduler's
// converged-reduction-split-drop counters recorded by p's last candidate-route
// parse attempt, whether that attempt routed or declined. ConvergedReduction
// SplitDrops counts every no-action head dropped that descended from a
// converged-path reduction split; ConvergedCoverageDrops counts the subset
// whose dropped header's recorded alternative set was contained in one
// surviving header's recorded set (spec.b4b-alternative-set.v2 section 5,
// renamed from SelectedLineageDrops at stage 2b). A routed parse always has
// drops == proved (the accept gate requires it); a mid-run decline can leave
// the two unequal at the point of the last completed drop.
//
// ok is false when p never attempted the candidate route (no cached runner) or
// the run never reached an acceptance receipt. The runner is per-Parser and
// reused across calls, so callers must read this immediately after Parse and
// before any other parse on the same Parser.
